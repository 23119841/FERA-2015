CLM-framework
=============

Framework for various Constrained Local Model based face tracking and landmark detection algorithms and their extensions/applications. Includes CLM, CLM-Z and CLNF algorithms. More details can be found in Readme.txt.

The stable versions of the framework have been tagged, the latest version of CLM-framework is is 0.9.2 and I recommend you download it.

FAME framework is still somewhat experimental and not as stable, it can be accessed in the FAME branch of the repository.
